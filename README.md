 Sveltekit + Firebase full stack CRUD app tutorial
```bash 
 npm run dev
 ```
worked in dashboard +page.svelte  
trying to replace todo with kcp  
fireship example may be too complex for this  
so I add saveKcp and need do the same with addKcp I guess  
and rebuild UI  
text field and add button already need to exist somewhere so multiply
and split view to person and activity
so check GitHub Copilot
